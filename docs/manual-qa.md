# Manual QA checklist

Automated tests and `scripts/validate-data.js` verify logic and data shape —
neither verifies that a UI change actually looks and behaves correctly (see
[.claude/rules/ui.md](../.claude/rules/ui.md)). Use this checklist after a
UI-facing change; treat it as an executable list, not a design essay. Check
only the rows relevant to what changed — you don't need every row for every
change, but don't skip a row that's clearly in scope.

Start the site locally (`preview_start`, or see README.md "Running
locally") before starting.

## Header

- [ ] Expanded state (every route except Session Prep): title, subtitle,
      compatibility label, nav links all visible and correctly ordered.
- [ ] Session Prep's collapsed chrome: toggling it visibly and meaningfully
      shrinks the header — not just a cosmetic tweak. Toggle back to
      expanded and confirm it restores exactly.

## Navigation

- [ ] Desktop: all header nav links (Lists, Session Prep, Journey, RU/EN)
      reachable by mouse and by keyboard (Tab + Enter), visible focus ring
      on each.
- [ ] Mobile width: nav still reachable, no overlap/clipping.

## Catalog

- [ ] Loading: skeleton shell shows before data arrives, no environment
      data visible.
- [ ] Populated: cards render, filters/search work, tier/type/biome/source
      filters combine correctly.
- [ ] Empty result: a search/filter combination with zero matches shows the
      empty state, not a blank grid.
- [ ] Failed load: simulate a data fetch failure (e.g. block
      `data/environments.json` in the network panel) and confirm
      `renderLoadError()`'s retry path works.

## Environment overlay

- [ ] An environment with `lore`, `source`, `biomes`, `featured_adversaries`,
      and `story_seeds` all present — every section renders in the right
      order.
- [ ] An environment missing all of the above optional fields — no broken
      layout, no placeholder text where a section is simply absent.
- [ ] Dice buttons, Fear-cost emphasis, and condition-name emphasis render
      and the dice buttons roll correctly.

## Lists

- [ ] Empty state (no lists yet).
- [ ] Populated: cover art, environment counts, open/delete controls work.
- [ ] Rename: valid rename persists; empty/whitespace-only input restores
      the previous name and shows the inline error; Escape cancels without
      persisting.
- [ ] Simulated storage failure on a valid rename: change stays in memory,
      `storage_write_failed_warning` toast shows instead of a success toast.

## Session Prep

- [ ] Empty (no selections yet): all three counters read zero, no stray
      "selected" styling anywhere.
- [ ] Partial (one or two environments, some adversaries/items selected).
- [ ] Populated (three environments — the cap — plus several
      adversaries/items).
- [ ] Long labels: a long environment/adversary/item name doesn't break the
      card layout in either language.
- [ ] **Multiple selected environments, no primary state**: select two or
      three environments and confirm nothing in the UI marks one as
      primary/default/main — no star, no "Make primary" control, no visual
      distinction beyond the shared `is-selected` styling. See
      [docs/product-decisions.md](product-decisions.md) PD-001.
- [ ] **Items are selected/unselected only, no quantity UI**: select the
      same item, confirm there's no stepper/+/-/quantity badge anywhere,
      and the "Selected: {n}" counter only ever increases by one per unique
      item. See PD-002.
- [ ] Three-environment cap: at the cap, unselected checkboxes disable, the
      persistent "Limit reached" status appears, and removing one
      re-enables the rest without losing search text/scroll position.
- [ ] Header chrome collapse/expand (see "Header" above) from within
      Session Prep specifically.

## Language

- [ ] English: full pass over whatever changed.
- [ ] Russian: full pass over whatever changed.
- [ ] A long Russian string (a long environment/list/session name) doesn't
      clip or overflow.
- [ ] Fallback behavior: a key or field missing in one language falls back
      to English rather than rendering blank.

## Accessibility

- [ ] Full keyboard navigation through whatever changed (Tab, Shift+Tab,
      Enter, Escape where applicable) — no mouse-only interaction.
- [ ] Visible focus ring (`:focus-visible`) on every interactive element
      touched by the change.
- [ ] Every interactive control has an accessible name (inspect with
      `preview_snapshot`, not just a screenshot).

## Viewport sizes

Use these for routine checks (see design.md's breakpoint table for exactly
what changes at each):

- [ ] Desktop (≥1200px)
- [ ] Narrow desktop / tablet (~641–1199px)
- [ ] Mobile (≤640px, and again at ≤480px if the change touches a control
      with a breakpoint there)
