# Daggerheart Atlas

Static site — plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step. `index.html` loads `css/styles.css`
and `js/app.js` directly; content lives in `data/environments.json` and `data/i18n.json`.

## Identity

This project is published under one identity only:

    Machenspieler <machenspieler@gmail.com>

Never write the following anywhere in this project — not in code, comments, commit
messages, commit author/committer fields, documentation, or generated output:

- the name `obfuscated`
- `obfuscated`
- `obfuscated`

This includes any real-name or work-address form of them. The repo-local git config
already sets the correct `user.name` and `user.email`; do not override it, and do not
fall back to a globally configured or auto-detected identity.

## Biome tagging

Every environment in `data/environments.json` carries a `biomes` array. Eleven biomes
describe real terrain and always take priority — check these first, in this order, and
tag any that the card's own text supports:

| id | covers |
| --- | --- |
| `underground` | caves, mines, fungal forests |
| `aquatic` | lake, sea, reef, delta |
| `wetland` | swamp, marsh, bog, fen |
| `grassland` | plains, veldt, savannah |
| `tropical` | jungle, rainforest, mangrove |
| `forest` | deciduous, evergreen, coniferous |
| `drylands` | desert, canyon, prairie, salt flat |
| `rolling` | hills, chaparral, moor, heath |
| `mountain` | plateau, montane, alpine |
| `frozen` | tundra, taiga, glacier |
| `badlands` | volcano, crystalline, barren |

Only when none of the eleven fits does an environment fall back to `settlement` (a
built, inhabited place: city, town, village, market, castle, temple, base) or
`universal`, shown as "Other" (no terrain at all: planar realms, space, dreams,
abstract scenes, and events that could happen anywhere).

Do not add new biome ids. Anything that isn't one of the eleven belongs in
`settlement` or `universal`.

An environment may carry more than one biome. List them most to least characteristic —
the first is the primary, the rest are secondary, tertiary, quaternary. Tag only what
the card's text actually supports; don't guess a terrain from the name alone.

## Cache busting

`index.html` references the stylesheet and script with a `?v=` query string. Bump the
number whenever `css/styles.css` or `js/app.js` changes, or browsers will serve stale
copies after deploy.

The JSON under `data/` is fetched by `js/app.js`, not linked from `index.html`, so it
carries its own buster: bump `DATA_VERSION` in `js/app.js` whenever any data file
changes. That edits `js/app.js`, so bump its `?v=` in `index.html` too.

## Unlisted deployment — do not undo

The site is deployed public-but-unlisted on purpose (see the "Unlisted public
deployment" section in README.md): `index.html` carries a static `noindex` tag, the
environment catalog is not present in the initial HTML, and `scripts/build.js` only
copies files — it does not prerender anything. `scripts/check-unlisted-build.js` runs
in CI to catch regressions.

Do not add SEO catalog output, crawler-discovery files, JSON-LD environment lists,
`llms.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, or server-side environment prerendering unless the
repository owner explicitly requests that the website become publicly discoverable
again.
